# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
Rooms and hallways are the hexagons in project 3. Generating the world is like the tesselation the rooms and hallways.
-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab, and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
First, the method of calculating the position of each component. Second, the method of creating the components with given parameters.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
A room has width and length greater than or equal to 2, while a hallway is one tile wide.
They are both spaces delimited by tiles.
